desc: "Logo for a new division of a small business solutions company. My client provided me with a few initial concepts he had thought of, but his primary requirement was that the logo use the colors of the American flag. I did pages of sketches for this logo, covering everything from simple type treatments to drawings of a trowel and chisel. In the end, I realized a simple arrangement of squares, one red, one white (or light grey if the background was white, one blue) solved all the requirements of the logo mark – simple and memorable, works well at different sizes, and incorporates the colors of the flag. The font is Aksidenz Grotesk, a precise, well-crafted geometric sans serif – embodying the qualities I wanted the logo to communicate about the company."
