desc: "An informational website for the Georgia Worker’s Compensation system, built with Nuxt.js. My client had an old, non responsive HTML web site that they wanted to update. The goal was for the updated site to have a pleasing, responsive design, be searchable, and be easy to update and add articles to. For this I chose Nuxt.js, a framework for Vue.js that allows for server-side rendering and rapid development. I created a simple Node/MongoDB backend and built an admin area for site administrators to add authors and articles to the site. To aid in rapid developing, I used the Bootstrap 4 framework for both the user-facing and administrative areas of the web site."
