desc: "Custom WordPress theme built for the Comics Experience web site, using Underscores as a starter theme and Bootstrap 4 for base styles and layout. The site hosts a podcast, and also features online seminar courses that can be purchased at varying times throughout the year. The site compares the starting date of the course against the current date and will adjust the course information and calls to action accordingly. I used the Repeater field from Advanced Custom Fields pro to create tabs on any pages that require them. In the Dashboard, users need only enter a tab name, ID and content for a given page, and the tabs will automatically be created."
