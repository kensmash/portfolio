desc: "Logo for a commercial and residential structures construction business. I was free to design whatever concept I wanted. I knew that I wanted to a modern design that communicated precision, and the name “Infinity” suggested an obvious mark. I played with a number of ideas, including rectangular structures in 3-point perspective, and combining the letter “i” and the infinity symbol. Ultimately, while playing around with the infinity symbol and type, I discovered that setting the infinity symbol above the first letter “i” created an interesting relationship between mark and type. I settled on Antartica Rounded for the type face. A well rendered sans serif with rounded terminals, it is modern and precise but friendly at the same time."
