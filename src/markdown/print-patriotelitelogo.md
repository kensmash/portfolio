desc: "Logo for a new saddle brand. The logo needed to be used on saddles (in metal), on hangtags, and work well in advertising materials and digital media. In keeping with the name, red, white and blue was a very logical color choice. I chose the beautiful serif font Quincy for the typeface, and paired it with some natural flag symbolism to create what I hoped was an appealing mark."
