desc: "Website for the First Presbyterian Church of Shelbyville, Kentucky to post events and newsletters, provide information, and collect donations. We settled on WordPress as a content management system, because it would be able to handle all of these requirements at no additional cost to the church. I designed and coded a custom theme using Underscores, Bourbon and Bitters for base styles and the excellent Typi and Mappy-breakpoints libraries to help with reponsive breakpoints and type sizes."
