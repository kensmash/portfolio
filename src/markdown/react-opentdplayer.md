desc: "Online trivia game I built for fun and learning. The app to connects to the Open Trivia Database and pull down a session token and categories on initialization. Then, when the user has selected a category and a difficulty, it fetches the questions and stores them in the React context. React-spring provides animated feedback and page transitions. It’s simple and works well overall. I’m happy with how this little side project turned out, and I’m eager to apply what I’ve learned about hooks, context and react-spring to other projects. The source code is available on Github."
